<h2>TO MY READERS</h2>

<p>An announcement that my lesson for the day would be
Spanish dishes, invariably brought record-breaking crowds in
any city in the United States, and a demand for recipes induced
me to search for the best to be found.</p>

<p>My three years' stay in California has enabled me to learn
how to prepare the very best dishes directly from the natives,
both Mexican and Spanish.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that Spanish dishes as they are
known in California are really Mexican Indian dishes. Bread
made of corn, sauces of chile peppers, jerked beef, tortillas,
enchiladas, etc., are unknown in Spain as native foods;
though the majority of Spanish people in California are as devoted
to peppery dishes as the Mexicans themselves, and as the
Mexicans speak Spanish, the foods are commonly called Spanish
dishes.</p>

<p>When made properly, there is great merit in this class of
foods and I have endeavored to select the very best recipes,
and have revised them into correct proportions and practical
methods of preparation.</p>

<p>Many of the dishes are very delicious and will be found of
great value for luncheon, entries, and a zest to various menus,
and especially useful to those who desire to cater to the public.
Please note the classification of sauces and dressings which
eliminates a repetition of the same sauce in different dishes.</p>

<p>Wishing you as much pleasure in the preparation and serving
of this collection of recipes as I have had in compiling them,
I am,</p>

<span class="caption">MEXICAN WOMAN MAKING TORTILLAS</span>

<p class="caption">Y. Y. Perez, Public Bakery, Sonora Town, Los Angeles. They
refuse to make them any other way and take the same pleasure
in making a perfectly thin and round tortilla that puffs up
nicely while cooking, as you and I do in trying to make a beautiful
loaf of bread. Truly the heart of women are the same the
world over. Deep down, no matter what the environment, the
desire is always there, to be &quot;loaf givers.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<h2>Tortillas</h2>

<h3>Modern Way to Prepare Corn for Tortilla and
Tamales</h3>

<p>Put one gallon of shelled corn in enough water
to cover; dissolve one-half cup lime in a little
water and add to cover; boil fifteen or twenty
minutes; remove from fire, pour off first water
and add fresh cold water; rub with hand to remove
husk. Rinse in another water and it is
ready to grind. Don't wash too much or it will
not be pasty enough to make tortilla.</p>

<h3>Tortillas No. 2</h3>

<p>Another way and liked best by some people:
Add to the corn dough (masa) rounding tablespoon
of lard to four cups dough, little salt.</p>

<h3>Tortillas No. 3</h3>

<p>Still another way: Corn meal and coarse flour
half and half wet to stiff dough, salt and lard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span></p>

<h3>Tortillas No. 4</h3>

<p>But the best to my taste is the hominy or corn
ground into a smooth paste, three cups corn, one
of flour, two tablespoons melted lard, teaspoon
salt, cook on ungreased iron, have ready enough
hot salted lard to dip tortilla in just before you
add filling to make Enchiladas. When flour is
used, dough may be rolled out on a board, a small
pie tin placed on and cut round the edge to form
cake; lift up with pancake turner.</p>

<h3>How to Shape Tortillas</h3>

<p>Take piece of dough size of biscuit and press
with hand into cake size of small pie plate, toast
on top of stove moderately warm. Do not brown.</p>

<h2><a name="Chile_Pulp_Sauces" id="Chile_Pulp_Sauces"></a>
Chile Pulp and Sauces for all Recipes</h2>

<p>Chile peppers are the base of all Mexican and
Spanish dishes, and I have simplified the various
recipes by making a list of different ways to
make the pepper pulps and sauces. Please note
that they are numbered and named, referred to
by number and name in the recipes. Original
way to prepare chile for sauce is to remove seed
and toast on coals, top of stove or in oven, till
they puff and look tender; and mash through
sieve or colander; add water or tomatoes for
right consistency; scalding is the quickest.</p>

<h3>No. 1, Red Chile Sauce, for Enchiladas or
Tamales, etc.</h3>

<p>Split red chile pepper, remove all seeds and
veins, soak several hours in water, pour off, pour
on boiling water, pour off and repeat again, the
last water just enough to cover peppers when
pressed down. Mash in this water and press
through sieve, melt one-half cup pure lard, add

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
